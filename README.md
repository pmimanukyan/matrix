# matrix

The program supports elementary operations on matrices, such as transposition, multiplication by scalar, sum and product of two matrices. Also it can solve a system of linear equations by Gauss method and raise a matrix to the natural power by binary exponentiation. In the project were used object oriented programming methods.
